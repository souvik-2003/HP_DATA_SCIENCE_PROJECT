🏗️ Setup & Installation

**1. Clone the repository**
- git clone https://github.com/yourusername/high-performance-data-science-app.git
- cd high-performance-data-science-app


**Note**: For Streamlit Cloud, all dependencies are auto-installed from requirements.txt with performance optimizations included.

**3. Add your datasets**
- Upload CSV/Excel files directly through the app (supports up to 1GB)
- Or place files in the `data/raw/` folder for batch processing
- Use the built-in sample data generator for testing (1K to 100K rows)

**4. Performance Configuration**
The app automatically detects your system capabilities and enables:
- Multi-core processing (uses all available CPU cores)
- Memory optimization (automatic data type conversion)
- Smart caching for repeated operations
- Batch processing for large datasets

🖥️ Running Locally

**streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py**


Then visit http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

For large datasets (10K+ rows), the app automatically enables high-performance mode! 🚀

☁️ Deploying on Streamlit Cloud

1. Push your repo to GitHub
2. Create a new app via Streamlit Cloud  
3. The app includes optimized `requirements.txt` and `.streamlit/config.toml` for cloud performance
4. Click "Deploy" - all performance optimizations are included!
5. Use "Clear cache" in the app management menu after updates

**Pro tip**: The cloud deployment includes automatic performance tuning for better speed! ⚡
